> Straightforward file browser for viewing markdown and other file types locally in Github-like fashion.

## Look Mum, No Hands

This project was put together to solve the problem of having to push changes to Github too often -while writing README, documentation files- just to see how they look live. It also lifts the burden of having to use static site generators to produce redundant html files from markdown while developing locally. 

Having a markdown viewer as a single PHP file keeps things simple and pleasant until you decide to push changes to Github for the world to see. 

## Getting Started

Drop `index.php` in your projects's documentation folder then view it in the browser, that's it!

## Baked-in Goodies
